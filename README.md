- **Frontend:** Built with Vite.js for fast development and a seamless user experience.
- **Backend:** Developed using Node.js with Express.js to create RESTful APIs.
- **Database:** Utilized MongoDB to store pantry items and track their expiry dates.
- **AI Models:** 
  - *Llama 3.1 70B* (SambaNova Cloud) for recipe generation.
  - *Llama 3.2 Vision 90B* for pantry item image recognition.
- **Notifications:** Integrated an email-based notification system to alert users about expiring items.
